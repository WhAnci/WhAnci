# Hey, there! 🌱
I'm SiHwan Lee, an AWS-focused cloud computing student with an interest in DevOps.

I like understanding how applications run in real environments, from infrastructure to deployment.

I learn best by building, testing, and iterating on small projects.

Most of what you see here reflects that process.

### Fun Fact:
- I aim to become an AWS expert. 👨‍💻
- I often study while listening to Chuu’s music. 💗
- I am learning Japanese with the goal of working in Japan. 🗾
- I am based in South Korea.
